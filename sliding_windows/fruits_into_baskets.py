# Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,
# you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket.
# The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
# You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree.
# You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
# Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
